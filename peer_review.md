## ðŸ”¹ 1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is cleanly structured, with clear section headings and smooth flow. Code blocks are well-separated from reflections. Excellent use of visualizations to show distributions and model performance.

**Suggestion:** Add brief comments inside code cells to improve code readability.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Feature Selection & Justification
The features chosen were appropriate for the target (`charges`). Smoking and BMI are key indicators, and the justification provided made sense.

**Suggestion:** Could try interaction terms (e.g., smoker Ã— BMI) or regularization models for further insight.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
All required models were built: base Linear Regression, Pipeline 1, and Polynomial Pipeline. Evaluation metrics (RÂ², MAE, RMSE) were included and explained.

**Suggestion:** Include bar plots to visually compare model performance.
